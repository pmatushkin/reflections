What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden directory for metadata. I need to run this command to transform the ordinary directory into the git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different from the working directory, because it only contains the files prepared for the next commit.
Staging area is different from the repository, because it only contains the files prepared for the next commit, not the files already committed.
This allows us to stage our commits by splitting the changes we already made into the logically separated stages.
